        Richard Linklater was among the first and most successful talents to emerge
        during the American independent film renaissance of the 1990s. Typically setting
        each of his movies during one 24-hour period, Linklater''s work explored what
        he dubbed \"the youth rebellion continuum,\" focusing in fine detail on generational
        rites and mores with rare compassion and understanding while definitively
        capturing the 20-something culture of his era through a series of nuanced,
        illuminating ensemble pieces which introduced any number of talented young
        actors into the Hollywood firmament.","birthday":"1960-07-30","deathday":"","homepage":"http://www.detourfilm.com/","id":564,"imdb_id":"nm0000500","name":"Richard
