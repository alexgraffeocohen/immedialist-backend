        Galactica is an American military science fiction television series, and part
        of the Battlestar Galactica franchise. The show was developed by Ronald D.
        Moore as a re-imagining of the 1978 Battlestar Galactica television series
        created by Glen A. Larson.\n\nThe story arc of Battlestar Galactica is set
        in a distant star system, where a civilization of humans live on a group of
        planets known as the Twelve Colonies. In the past, the Colonies had been at
        war with a cybernetic race of their own creation, known as the Cylons. With
        the unwitting help of a human named Gaius Baltar, the Cylons launch a sudden
        sneak attack on the Colonies, laying waste to the planets and devastating
        their populations. Out of a population numbering in the billions, only approximately
        50,000 humans survive, most of whom were aboard civilian ships that avoided
        destruction. Of all the Colonial Fleet, the eponymous Battlestar Galactica
        appears to be the only military capital ship that survived the attack. Under
        the leadership of Colonial Fleet officer Commander William \"Bill\" Adama
        and President Laura Roslin, the Galactica and its crew take up the task of
        leading the small fugitive fleet of survivors into space in search of a fabled
        refuge known as Earth.","first_air_date":"2005-01-14","origin_country":["US","CA","GB"],"genre_ids":[28,12,18,14,878],"original_language":"en","vote_count":81,"name":"Battlestar

        a freighter. His co-pilot, Lt. Coker Fasjovic, isn''t too keen on having a
        rookie flying his aircraft as he has only a short time before he again becomes
        a civilian. Their cargo is a civilian scientist, Dr. Becca Kelly, but they
        no sooner leave than she has new orders for them and a new destination. She
        is less than forthcoming about just what her secret mission is but Adama is
        keen, particularly as it involves going into Cylon controlled space. Nothing
        is as it seems however. --- Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome is a prequel

        Galactica: The Resistance is the collective title of 10 two- to five-minute
        \"webisodes\" released exclusively on the world wide web through the Sci Fi
        Channel''s website. The serial storyline follows events that occur between
        the close of season 2 and the beginning of season 3 of the re-imagined Battlestar
        Galactica TV series.\n\nThe first webisode was released on September 5, 2006,
        with two subsequent webisodes posted to the site each week through October
        5 to lead into the season 3 premiere.\n\nThe series was produced as a promotional
        event to promote Battlestar Galactica, and as such generates no residuals
        for its writers. The original title of this series was to be Battlestar Galactica:
        Crossroads but \"Crossroads\" was later used as the title of the third-season
        finale instead. The WGA has called for the boycott of all un-residualed webisodes
        by writers and producers from working on them.\n\nThe webisodes are only available
        for viewers from the United States, to the dismay of many fans worldwide;
        the decision to restrict the webisodes to the US has forced international
        fans to use peer-to-peer networks to get content which is supposedly free.
        The webisodes were later reposted on various free video hosting sites, such
        as YouTube but have since been removed at \"the request of copyright owner
        NBC Universal because its content was used without permission\". In late 2006,
        with Australia''s Network Ten broadcasting of the third season of Battlestar
        Galactica on Ten HD, The Resistance webisodes were made available to the Australian
        public on the network''s website but have since been taken down.","first_air_date":"2006-09-05","origin_country":["US"],"genre_ids":[878,18,10765],"original_language":"en","vote_count":1,"name":"Battlestar
